# Outer Space

An astronaut is travelling through space after his spacecraft malfunctioned, in an attempt to reach back to earth. The astronaut has a special gun that shoots different kinds of projectiles using materials collected. These materials are floating around space and different projectiles require a different amount of materials obtained. The astronaut must evade or shoot monsters and asteroids, to stay alive. The speed of the game increases periodically over time.
